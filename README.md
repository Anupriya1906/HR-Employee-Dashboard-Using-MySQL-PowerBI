## Introduction
 In this project, I have curated and analyzed a dataset containing detailed information about HR employees, including hire date, birth date, termination date, and other workplace details.

## Use case

### Source Data Set

### SQL Scripts

### Dashboard Creation Using Power BI
The results of the queries are exported to separate CSV file, and the data is then loaded into Power BI to generate a straightforward dashboard illustrating various details about human resources employees. The final output is a dynamic and insightful dashboard that visually represents key metrics related to the HR employees, offering valuable insights into their demographics, tenure, and other relevant factors.
